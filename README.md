# FruitTreesAPI

This REST API aims to provide data about apple trees for developers who are interested in a gardening related API.
At the time of the release, it is a very underserved area where no API of this kind is available.

This AppleTrees collection serves as a template for future development of this API. The goal is to include data for all common fruit tree types such as 
pears, plums, persimmons...


The AppleTrees collection contains the most essential information for selecting the right variety to purchase and plant. 
Here is a breif description of each field of the API response:
- Taste: flavour and texture of the fruit 
- Zone: winter hardiness is the most important limiting factor for a plant's survival
- Bloom: bloom time is important because it determines which variety could be a compatible pollination partner. Most apple trees are not self-fertile, which means
a compatible variety must also be present within 100 feet in order to get fruits from the tree.
- Harvest: harvest time is useful when selecting which varities to include in one's orchard in order to get continuous harvests throughout the season instead of
an overwhelming amount at one time of the year.
